## **Problem statement**:
1.Lack of Timely Disease Detection:  Farmers often face significant crop losses due to the inability to detect plant diseases early, resulting in reduced yields and wasted resources.
2.Unpredictable Weather Conditions: With the increasing unpredictability of weather due to climate change, farmers struggle to make informed decisions about planting, irrigation, and harvesting.
3.Inefficient Use of Fertilizers: Many farmers lack access to accurate fertilizer recommendations, leading to either overuse or underuse, which affects both yield and soil health.
4.Fluctuating Market Prices: Farmers are often uninformed about real-time market prices, leading to unfavorable sales of their produce and financial instability.
5.Limited Access to Expert Guidance: Many smallholder farmers lack access to expert agricultural consultants who could provide tailored advice to improve their productivity and profitability.
